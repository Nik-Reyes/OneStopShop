        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>12 ounces dried black beans</li>
          <li>
            handful of dried avocado leavs, lightly toasted in a dry skillet

            8 ounces (about 1 cup) Mexican fresh chorizo sausage, removed from
            its casing
          </li>
          <li>About 1/2 cup Roasted Tomatillo Salsa OR</li>
          <li>About 1/2 cup Smoky Chipotle Salsa</li>
          <li>
            About 1/2 cup crumbled Mexican queso fresco or other fresh cheese
            like salted pressed farmers cheese or goat cheese
          </li>
          <li>
            A couple of thin white onion slices, broken into rings and rinsed
          </li>
          <li>A handful of flat-leaf parsley leaves</li>
          <li>12 corn tortillas</li>
          <li>
            A little vegetable oil, for brushing or spraying the tortillas
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <p>
          <strong>Cook the beans.</strong> If cooking on the stovetop, measure
          the beans into a large (4-quart) saucepan. Add the optional avocado
          leaves, the chipotles, garlic and 6 cups water. Bring to a boil,
          partially cover, then reduce the heat so that the beans simmer very
          gently until tender, usually about 2 hours. If the water drops below
          the level of the beans, add more, so that they float freely.
        </p>
        <p>
          If using a slow-cooker, combine the beans, avocado leaves (if using),
          chipotle chiles, garlic and 6 cups water and cook covered on high
          until the beans are completely tender, usually about 6 hours.
        </p>
        <p>
          If using a pressure cooker (like an Instant Pot), combine the beans,
          avocado leaves (if using), chipotle chiles, garlic and 6 cups water
          and pressure cook for 1 hour, until the beans are tender. Let the
          pressure release naturally for 15 minutes, then release the pressure
          valve and continue with the recipe.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Make the sauce.</strong> Strain the beans over a bowl and pour
          all the broth into a blender jar. Remove the avocado leaves (if
          using), then measure ¾ cup of the beans in with the broth and blend
          until completely smooth. (Refrigerate the remaining beans for another
          dish—they are perfect for classic Mexican fried beans.) Pour the sauce
          into a medium (3-quart) saucepan, set over medium heat and simmer
          briskly, stirring occasionally, until the consistency is that of a
          cream soup (the quantity will have reduced to 2 ½ cups), about 30
          minutes. Taste and season with salt, usually a generous teaspoon.
          Cover and keep warm on low heat.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>The garnishes.</strong> In a medium (9-inch) skillet, fry the
          chorizo over medium heat, breaking up clumps, until browned and
          completely cooked through, about 10 minutes. (If the chorizo doesn’t
          immediately start to render fat, you’ll want to add a little oil to
          the skillet to ensure even cooking.) Use a slotted spoon to scoop the
          chorizo onto a plate lined with paper towel to drain. (And you can
          save the fat to fry the leftover beans in!). Set out the salsa,
          cheese, sliced onion and parsley because assembling the enfrijoladas
          goes quickly.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>The tortillas.</strong> Lightly brush or spray both sides of
          each tortilla with oil. Slide into a plastic bag (don’t seal) or wrap
          in plastic and microwave at 100% power for 45 seconds to warm and
          soften. Let stand 1 minute until cool enough to handle.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Finish the enfrijoladas</strong>. Set out 4 warm dinner
          plates. One by one dip the tortillas into the hot bean broth, lay on a
          plate, then fold in half. Arrange 3 tortillas on each plate, slightly
          overlapping. Ladle a portion of the hot sauce over each serving, spoon
          on chorizo, splash on the salsa, sprinkle with the cheese and strew
          with parsley leaves. Serve without hesitation.
