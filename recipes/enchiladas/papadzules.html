          <li>8 eggs, hardboiled and chopped</li>
          <li>12 warm corn tortillas></li>
        </ul>

        <h3>For the Tomate Frito (Makes About 2 Cups)</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>1 1/2 pounds (6 medium or 9 to 12 plum) ripe tomatoes</li>
          <li>1 1/2 tablespoons rich-tasting lard or olive oil</li>
          <li>1 small white onion, diced</li>
          <li>1 fresh habanero chile, halved</li>
          <li>Salt, about 1/2 teaspoon</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <p>
          <strong>Make the Tomate Frito.</strong> Roast the tomatoes using the
          the griddle method or the broiler method. For the griddle, line a
          griddle or heavy skillet with aluminum foil and heat over medium. Lay
          the tomatoes on the foil and roast, turning several times, until
          blistered, blackened and softened, about 10 minutes. (Don’t worry if
          some of the skin sticks to the foil.) For the broiler method, lay the
          tomatoes on a baking sheet and place about 4 inches below a very hot
          broiler. Roast until blistered and blackened on one side, about 6
          minutes; flip the tomatoes and roast the other side.
        </p>
        <p>
          Cool, then peel, collecting any juices with the tomatoes. Coarsely
          puree tomatoes and juices in a food processor or blender.
        </p>
        <p>
          In a medium-size (2- to 3-quart) skillet, heat the lard or oil over
          medium. Add the onion and sauté until deep golden, about 8 minutes.
          Add the tomatoes and chile halves and simmer 15 minutes or so,
          stirring often, until nicely reduced but not dry (it should be an
          easily spoonable consistency). Taste (it will be wonderfully picante
          and nicely perfumed), season with salt, remove the chile if you want,
          and it’s ready to use.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Make the epazote broth.</strong> In a medium (2-quart)
          saucepan, bring the water, epazote, onion and salt to a boil. Simmer
          for five minutes. Remove from heat for 15 minutes. Strain.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Make the pumpkinseed sauce.</strong> Set a large (10-inch)
          skillet over medium heat. Pour the pumpkinseeds into a small skillet
          and set over medium heat. When the first one pops, stir constantly
          until all have popped from flat to round, about 5 minutes. In a
          high-speed blender set to high or a food processor, blend the toasted
          pumpkinseeds and epazote broth.
        </p>
        <p>
          In a large saucepan set over low heat, add the pureed pepita sauce and
          warm through. It should be thick enough to warm the back of a spoon.
          (If the sauce boils, it will look curdled. Don't worry. Reblending the
          sauce in a loosely covered blended will smooth it out.)
        </p>
        <p>
          Top a tortilla with chopped egg and roll it up, repeating the process
          until all of the tortillas are filled. Ladle with pumpkinseed sauce
          and garnish with tomato frito and more chopped egg.
