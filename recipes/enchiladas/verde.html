            2 3/4 cups (12 ounces) cooked, coarsely shredded, boneless chicken,

            Chihuahua, quesadilla or asadero) or Monterey Jack, brick or mild

            the oven
          </li>
          <li>A handful of cilantro leaves (optional)</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <p>
          <strong>Make a roasted tomatillo base.</strong> On a rimmed baking
          sheet, spread out tomatillos, garlic, serrano, and the small white
          onion, sliced ½ inch thick. Slide the baking sheet as close up under a
          preheated broiler as possible. After 4 or 5 minutes, when everything
          is blotchy-black and softening, turn the vegetables and roast the
          other side until everything is cooked through (they should be soft),
          while taking on an attractive bit of rustic char. Once the vegetables
          are roasted, they go on the stove top to cool down a little.
        </p>
        <p>
          When the vegetables have cooled down enough to handle, slip the skins
          off the garlic and pull the stem off the chiles.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Blend the roasted ingredients.</strong> In a blender, combine
          the tomatillos (and any juice on the baking sheet), garlic, chiles,
          onion and a scant teaspoon salt, and blend everything to a coarse
          puree.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>In a large (10-inch) skillet.</strong> Over medium-high heat
          measure the oil or lard. When it’s hot, add the roasted tomatillo
          sauce base. Let the sauce reduce and concentrate, stirring it
          frequently, for about 4 minutes. When it’s thicker than spaghetti
          sauce, stir in chicken broth and cilantro or parsley. Season the sauce
          with salt, turn the heat down to medium-low and let it simmer while
          you prepare the filling.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Measure out your choice of filling.</strong> Turn on the oven
          to 400 degrees. Spray or brush with oil on one side of the tortillas
          then stack them up, slip them into a plastic bag, fold it over and
          microwave them at 100% for 1 minute. Let them stand for a minute (to
          uniformly absorb the heat) while you stir a little sauce into the meat
          to moisten it (the cheese needs no sauce). Then lay out the tortillas
          on the counter, top them each with a portion cup of the meat or
          cheese, roll them up and fit them into a 13 x 9-inch baking dish.
          Spoon the hot sauce over them (covering the whole tortilla avoids dry
          ends), slide them into the oven and bake just until heated
          through—about 4 minutes. Longer in the oven means mushy enchiladas.
        </p>
        <p>
          To serve the enchiladas, simply use a spatula to transfer them to
          dinner plates. Garnish the enchiladas with the topping(s) of your
          choice, crema, cheese, white onion, and or cilantro leaves.
