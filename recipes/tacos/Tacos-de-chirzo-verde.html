        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>1 large fresh poblano chile</li>
          <li>4 garlic cloves, peeled and cut in half</li>
          <li>1 or 2 fresh serrano chiles, stemmed and roughly chopped</li>
          <li>
            1 medium bunch cilantro (tough lower stems cut off, the leafy parts
            roughly chopped)
          </li>
          <li>
            1 medium bunch parsley (tough lower stems cut off, the leafy parts
            roughly chopped)
          </li>
          <li>
            1 1/2 pounds ground pork (you’ll need pork that’s a little fatty—25
            to 30%—and preferably coarsely ground)
          </li>
          <li>
            3 tablespoons spinach powder (available online and at well-stocked
            grocery stores)
          </li>
          <li>2 tablespoons rice winr vinegar</li>
          <li>2 teaspoons table salt</li>
          <li>16 warm corn tortillas,</li>
          <li>1 generous cup Frijoles Refritos (recipe linked above)</li>
          <li>1 large avocado, cut into 16 slices</li>
          <li>1 generous cup salsa verde</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <p>
          <strong>Prepare the flavorings.</strong> Roast the poblano chile
          directly over a gas flame or 4 inches below a very hot electric
          broiler, turning regularly until blistered and blackened all over,
          about 5 minutes for an open flame, about 10 minutes for the broiler.
          Cool until handleable, rub off the blackened skin, tear open and pull
          out the stem and seed pod. Quickly rinse to remove any seeds or bits
          of skin. Roughly chop and scoop into a food processor, along with the
          garlic, serrano(s), cilantro and parsley. Pulse until uniformly
          chopped, then run the machine until you have a coarse puree, scraping
          down the sides until you have a coarse puree.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Finish the chorizo verde.</strong> In a large bowl, combine
          the pork with the green seasonings, spinach powder, vinegar, and
          salt—your hand is the most efficient utensil for working the
          seasonings thoroughly into the meat. Cover and refrigerate until
          you’re ready to make the tacos. Honestly, making this a day ahead
          improves its flavor, but it can hold for several days (or freeze for
          several months).
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Cook the chorizo, make the tacos.</strong> Break up the
          chorizo as you transfer it to a 12-inch non-stick skillet set over
          medium-high heat. If it doesn’t begin to render fat right away, stir
          in a little oil. Cook, turning frequently and breaking up any clumps,
          until the meat looks cooked through (there will be browned edges), 8
          to 10 minutes. To make the tacos, smear a little beans on a tortilla,
          top with a scoop of chorizo and a slice of avocado, then add salsa.
          It’s a beautiful mouthful.
