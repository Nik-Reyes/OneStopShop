            <li>24 warm corn tortillas,</li>
          </ul>
          <h3>Optional Toppings</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              About 1 1/2 cups salsa (Roasted Tomatillo Salsa OR a bottle of
              Mexican hot sauce; like Tamazula, Valentina or Búfalo)
            </li>
            <li>
              About a cup (about 4 ounces) crumbled Mexican queso fresco or

            <li>guacamole sencillo</li>

          <h2>Instructions</h2>
          <p>
            <strong>Brown the beef and onion.</strong> Heat the oil in a very
            large (12-inch) skillet (preferably cast iron) over medium-high.
            When hot, add the beef. Use a spatula to break up the beef into
            small pieces that cover the whole skillet. Let cook undisturbed
            until the meat is browned, 6 to 8 minutes. Then use the spatula to
            turn everything over, sprinkle in the onions, and brown the other
            side. Use the spatula to break the pieces into smaller ones.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Add potatoes and garlic.</strong> While the beef is
            browning, scoop the potatoes into a microwave-safe bowl, sprinkle
            liberally with salt, add a splash of water, cover (if using plastic
            wrap, poke a couple of holes) and microwave until tender, about 4
            minutes. Uncover (be careful of the steam), drain and add to the
            beef along with the garlic. Turn the heat down to medium and cook,
            stirring regularly, for several minutes until the potatoes break up
            a bit.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>The Seasonings.</strong> Stir in the herbs, spices and
            Worcestershire. Add the tomatoes, jalapeños and optional olives. As
            the mixture starts to thicken, use your spatula to break up the
            tomato pieces into smaller ones. When the liquid has reduced and the
            mixture will hold its shape in a spoon, taste and season with salt,
            if you think it needs it.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Serve.</strong> Set out the picadillo with warm tortillas,
            the optional toppings, and let everyone make tacos to their heart’s
            content.
