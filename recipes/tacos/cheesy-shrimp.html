          <h2>Ingredients</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>
              12 ounces (2 medium-small round or 4 or 5 plum) ripe tomatoes, cut
              into 1/4 inch pieces
            </li>
            <li>
              Fresh serrano chiles to taste, (roughly 3 to 5, or even more if
              you like it really picante), stemmed, seeded if you wish, and
              finely chopped
            </li>
            <li>1/4 cup chopped cilantro, thick bottom stems removed</li>
            <li>1 large garlic clove, peeled and very finely chopped</li>
            <li>1 small white onion, finely chopped</li>
            <li>
              1 tablespoon Mexican hot sauce (such as Valentina or Tamazula),
              plus extra for serving
            </li>
            <li>1 tablespoon ketchup</li>
            <li>
              2 teaspoons fresh lime juice (optional, but you might like the
              zing it adds)
            </li>
            <li>Salt</li>
            <li>About 1/3 cup vegetable oil, divided use</li>
            <li>
              1 pound small shrimp, peeled, deveined if you wish, and chopped
              into pieces a little smaller than 1/2 inch
            </li>
            <li>15 corn tortillas</li>
            <li>
              8 ounces shredded Mexican melting cheese (full-flavored Chihuahua
              or Jack cheese work best)
            </li>
          </ul>
          <h2>Instructions</h2>
          <p>
            <strong>Making the salsa.</strong> Scoop the tomatoes, chiles,
            cilantro, garlic and white onion into a bowl and mix well. Stir in
            the hot sauce, ketchup and optional lime juice. Taste and season
            with salt, usually about a scant teaspoon.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Making the shrimp filling.</strong> Heat a very large
            (12-inch), heavy skillet—nonstick works really well—over
            medium-high. Pour in 2 tablespoons of the oil and when it is hot,
            add the “salsa” vegetables. Cook, stirring regularly, until
            everything softens together, about 5 minutes. Scoop in the shrimp
            and stir until they are barely cooked through (they can still be
            slightly translucent at the center)—about 3 minutes. Scoop the
            shrimp mixture into a bowl, wash and dry the skillet, and return it
            to medium heat.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Assembling the encamaronadas.</strong>Heavily film the
            bottom of the skillet with oil. When hot, lay in a tortilla. After a
            few seconds, flip it, then scatter a couple of tablespoons of
            shredded cheese over one side, top with a generous tablespoon of the
            filling. Use tongs to fold the uncovered part of the tortilla over
            the filling, forming a turnover. Gently press flat. Continue to make
            encamaronadas in the same fashion until the skillet is full, frying
            them until crisp—2 to 3 minutes per side. As they become crisp,
            remove them to a plate lined with paper towels. Serve right away
            with more Mexican hot sauce.
